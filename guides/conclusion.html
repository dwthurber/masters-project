      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>The conclusion is a “space to argue for the importance of the study” and pull the research ‘story’ together. For example, you might conclude by returning to the introduction, summarize key findings, acknowledge the lack of conclusion to the study itself, ensure the "so what" questions are answered, speculate about the future of the topic, or consider the methodological implications of the study (discussion).</p>
